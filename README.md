Word-to-Folder Converter
The Word-to-Folder Converter is a Python script that reads a list of words from a text file and converts each word into a folder with the same name. The program is useful for quickly creating a set of folders based on a list of keywords, which can be helpful for organizing files, data, or projects.

Usage
Create a text file with one word per line, and save it as words.txt in the same directory as the script.
Run the script using a Python interpreter (version 3 or higher) in a terminal or command prompt.
The program will automatically create a folder for each word in the current working directory.
Note: You can modify the file path in the script to use a different file name or location.

Requirements
