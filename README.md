<h1>Word-to-Folder Converter</h1>
<p>The Word-to-Folder Converter is a Python script that reads a list of words from a text file and converts each word into a folder with the same name. The program is useful for quickly creating a set of folders based on a list of keywords, which can be helpful for organizing files, data, or projects.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a text file with one word per line, and save it as <code>words.txt</code> in the same directory as the script.</li>
<li>Run the script using a Python interpreter (version 3 or higher) in a terminal or command prompt.</li>
<li>The program will automatically create a folder for each word in the current working directory.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: You can modify the file path in the script to use a different file name or location.</p>
